## **Transcript of Interview Recording**

**\[Start of Recording]**

I’ve been working on this on and off for more than a year, so I’m super familiar with all the details. But honestly, it really took me less than a day during the weekend to put everything together.

From the start, I had everything ready—the documents and the code. I just started with the shift while the two of these, and that’s pretty much it. Then I used some old QGIS files and some model files to show the workflows. That’s pretty much it. It took me about an hour to write the code—it was super easy.

I really feel like vibe coding is a very good fit for this type of work because, you know, for GIS—like Model Builder and QGIS—we all have the model builder toolbox. We’ve been doing that for a very long time. You have visual programming like the model builder, so you can just drag and drop all the different tasks and connect those together.

With these tools, you can probably get 80–90% of the job done, but there’s still that 10–20% where visual programming tools are not flexible enough. You can’t do everything. That was the case for me—I could get probably 80% done with Model Builder, but the remaining 20% made it very hard to package a universal tool and share it with someone else.

If I do this, it’s not super hard—I already know part of it—but it’s still quite a few steps to go through. If you ask someone else to just read that and do it, it’s still pretty hard. But with vibe coding, within an hour—bear in mind this was kind of the first or second time I did this—I didn’t write a single line of code and got the whole thing done.

Vibe coding is reliable for this kind of work because the model processing still calls the actual tools. So what vibe coding really does is come up with the right parameters and orchestrate the whole workflow—where you save things and so on. Another nice thing is it builds a pretty nice UI on top of it.

**\[Continuation]**

It’s pretty nice—I just used vibe coding for the UI part of it. Honestly, the thing is pretty reliable because for this whole thing to work, it calls the actual tools and processes them. If something looks right, it’s very hard for it to go wrong because it doesn’t write the actual code to do the heavy lifting—it just calls the existing tools.

That’s why I say this is pretty good. You already know 80% of how it’s supposed to work, so vibe coding is doing the remaining 20%—making it look nicer and connecting all the different parts of the tools. That’s a perfect use case.

Another thing I want to touch on: vibe coding is not only good for coding—it’s also very good for research. For example, the document I shared about 2D flow versus 2D elements—I have some pretty good insights into these things. I had the prompt, but 90% of the document was written by AI. I asked it to go out and do research and check a few quotes. I’ve read a lot of these in the past, so they’re accurate. I’m very satisfied with the way it put everything together. Honestly, it probably does a better job than I could explaining these things.

In my opinion, this is a very well-put-together tool with very good documentation. I got everything done in under 2–3 hours. But like I said, I spent almost 6 months—or maybe a year—before that doing all the research. Just putting everything together with vibe coding was super fast. I’m very glad.

Also, this is not my first time using it. I probably started in April and really got into it later. Before that, I used it a little bit. But I’m really surprised by the results.
