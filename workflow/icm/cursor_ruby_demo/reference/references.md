# Reference examples (download separately)

In the demo workflow, the “AI intern” learns faster when you provide **real InfoWorks ICM Ruby examples**. This repo stays lightweight, so the example library is **not** included here.

## Recommended source
- Innovyze / InfoWorks open-source examples: [innovyze/Open-Source-Support](https://github.com/innovyze/Open-Source-Support)

## How to download
Option A: download a ZIP from GitHub.

Option B: clone with git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/innovyze/Open-Source-Support.git
```

## How to use the examples (with an AI coding assistant)
1. Copy the `Open-Source-Support/01 InfoWorks ICM/01 Ruby/` from the downloaded repo.
2. Add them to a local `reference/` folder.
3. Ask your AI assistant to read those scripts and produce a short “cheat sheet” of patterns.
4. Then provide your requirements (see [`docs/workflow.md`](../docs/workflow.md)) and iterate.
