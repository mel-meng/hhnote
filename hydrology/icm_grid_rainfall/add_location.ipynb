    "# Spatial Rainfall in InfoWork ICM Rainfall Data Object\n",
    "\n",
    "To add spatial rainfall into InfoWorks ICM Rainfall object, spatial information is added to the \"Rain Gage Data\" attribute. It can be \n",
    "* a location of x, y\n",
    "* a region of a polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "For traditional rain gage network, the workflow is,\n",
    "* add rainfall profile for each rain gage\n",
    "* add rain gage to Geoplan at its location\n",
    "* generate thiessen polygon for each rain gage\n",
    "* save the gage data into the rainfall profile\n",
    "\n",
    "For rainfall such as radar rainfall, the workflow will be different, ususaly the processed data will include,\n",
    "* a table with profile for each cell\n",
    "* a polygon layer with each polgyon as a cell\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a spatial rainfall object from such data,\n",
    "* import the table as a rainfall object, each profile is a cell\n",
    "* create a polygon layer with a filed \"PROFILE\", the value should match the rainfall profile for each cell\n",
    "* import the polygon layer as rain gage polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue for this workflow is that the profile is not labeled, only the polygon boundary is shown. To show the label, we need to add the location of the centroid of each cell, so that ICM knows to label it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script below will fix that problem.\n"
