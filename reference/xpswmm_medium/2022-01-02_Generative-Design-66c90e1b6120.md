### Generative Design

When designing and operating a collection system, we have two very important tasks.

* Optimizing the design/operating parameters to maximize the benefits while minimize the cost.
* Calibrating the model parameters to maximize its accuracy and reliability of the model

Traditionally these tasks are carried out by engineers and modelers manually through tedious trial and error process, it has two major drawbacks,

* the intuition and experiences play a very important role in the quality of the outcome.
* it is a slow and expensive process, which makes it very hard to update the design when new information is available.

With the rise of big data, AI and cloud computing, [Generative design](https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/generative-design?mktvar002=678907&ef_id=Cj0KCQiAt8WOBhDbARIsANQLp97IOLGCkMlFQ8H2KHoYEVRm1qQ187nyLxGqotk4zR92kTUn1a-Ohh8aAl1NEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!11172!3!330171926125!e!!g!!generative%20design!621448685!27870611445&mkwid=sMxVoYQPt|pcrid|330171926125|pkw|generative%20design|pmt|e|pdv|c|slid||pgrid|27870611445|ptaid|kwd-3935580345|pid|&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=GGL_DM_FOMT-Generative_AMER_US_Visits_SEM_NBR_NEW_EX_ADSK_3461051&utm_term=generative%20design&utm_content=sMxVoYQPt|pcrid|330171926125|pkw|generative%20design|pmt|e|pdv|c|slid||pgrid|27870611445|ptaid|kwd-3935580345|&gclid=Cj0KCQiAt8WOBhDbARIsANQLp97IOLGCkMlFQ8H2KHoYEVRm1qQ187nyLxGqotk4zR92kTUn1a-Ohh8aAl1NEALw_wcB) is gaining more traction in the civil community in search for a better solution.

With this approach, the designerâ€™s job is to work with the computer program to define the design goals and constraints, and let the algorithm guide the discovery of the best design rather than relying on the intuition and experiences of the designer alone.

This new approach will require a new breed of software, and for water modeling, we are still very early in this game.

However, for modelers who would like to get a glimpse of what it might look like, I prepared a few simple examples using python to demonstrate how to do generative design with SWMM5. It will cover the following key steps in a few follow up blog posts.

* how to create, run, modify a SWMM5 model using python
* how to extract results from a SWMM5 model
* how to do multiple-objective optimization with a SWMM5 model
