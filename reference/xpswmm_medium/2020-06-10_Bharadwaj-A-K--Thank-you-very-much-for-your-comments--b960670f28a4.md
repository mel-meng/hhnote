[Bharadwaj A K](https://medium.com/@akbharad?source=responses---------0-----------------------), Thank you very much for your comments. I don’t know too much about the best method to model flow splits.

I’ve done some sewer cleaning projects, and the actual condition in the field can be very different from the design and modeled condition. Therefore, if it is a major flow split, I think some field verification will be needed. And if it is a design, then more detailed analysis will be needed to ensure the structure behaves as designed.
