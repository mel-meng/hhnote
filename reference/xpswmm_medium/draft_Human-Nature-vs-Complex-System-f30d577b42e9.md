### Human Nature vs Complex System

The geography classes I took to get a second GIS degree opened my eyes to the humanity side of the world. I found looking at engineering problems through the lens of humanity can suddenly turn any problems sophisticated and more interesting. On the other hand, I also realized how ignorant I am and how limited my perspective can be when solving real world problem.

And that’s about it for my humanity education, I am way more interested in the more orderly world of engineering and kind of forgot the important lessons I’ve learned.

When trying to comprehend and judge moral dilemmas of this scale, people often resort to one of four methods

* downsize the issue: simply the conflicts of two countries as two peoples fight, one is good and the other is bad.
* develop a touching human story
* weave conspiracy theories
* create a dogma
