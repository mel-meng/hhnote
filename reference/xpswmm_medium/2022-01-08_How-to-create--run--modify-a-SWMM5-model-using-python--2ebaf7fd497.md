### How to create, run, modify a SWMM5 model using python?

This blog is part of the [Generative design](https://mel-meng-pe.medium.com/generative-design-66c90e1b6120) series. To do generative design we need to run hundreds and thousands of simulations to discovery the best design. In this post, we’ll write the python code to,

* create a model from a template with a new set of parameters
* run the model
* extract the results

The code and example can be found on [github](https://github.com/mel-meng/SewerAnalysis/blob/master/examples/optimize/run_swmm_from_script.ipynb).
