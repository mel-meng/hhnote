Flow monitoring data analysis is very important for sanitary sewer systems.

For I/I studies, estimating the RTK values are usually the first step to understand the nature and magnitude of the I/I in each basin before making decisions on prioritizing more detailed studies among the basins.

For model calibration, working with flow data is a key skill to extract dry weather flow diurnal patterns, ground water infiltration rate, and then calibrate RDII parameters.

For me doing flow monitoring data analysis is like watching a detective movie, how can I understand what is actually happening in the system just by looking at the flow at the outlet of the basin. It takes a lot of patience and skills, and every case is different. Even after working on hundreds of flow meters, I still learn something new every time I look at some new flow data. A flow meter basin is like a person, no two are exactly the same.

That’s why I am so excited about this post. I’ll show you there has never been a better time doing flow analysis with python. I bet you’ll agree with me after reading my post, python is getting so powerful when it comes to exploratory data analysis, most likely it is our imagination, not the tools that are limiting what we can do with the flow data.
