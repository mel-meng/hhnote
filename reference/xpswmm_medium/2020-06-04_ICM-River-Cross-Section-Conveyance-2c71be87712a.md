During the ICM training two weeks back, I found it is hard to explain how to fix a conveyance curve. So I decided to take a closer look at it, and run some sensitivity analysis. I don’t think I have a definitive answer, but the steps I went through should be a great starting point if I question my   
conveyance curve next time.

Here is the [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mel-meng/SewerAnalysis/blob/master/references/river/conveyance/ICM%20conveyance%20curve%20sensitivity%20analysis.ipynb) and you can find the source code on [github](https://github.com/mel-meng/SewerAnalysis/blob/master/references/river/conveyance/ICM%20conveyance%20curve%20sensitivity%20analysis.ipynb).
