### InfoWorks ICM GeoPlan Tips

source: [Innovyze Support Portal](https://innovyze.force.com/support/s/article/InfoWorks-ICM-GeoPlan-Tips)

InfoWorks ICM has its own way of managing the different layers and the styles for the map of the model. It might take new users some time to get familiar with the conventions if coming from a CAD or GIS background.

GeoPlan is the main window showing the model and other map layers. It is used to edit the network and review simulation results. The way it works is very similar to GIS software, objects are grouped into layers with the same type of geometries, and are styled based on their attributes. However, the user interface can feel quite different. Here are a few major differences,

* There is no layer tree where you can access all the layer options. You need to go to the GeoPlan Properties and Themes for these changes. With the Thematic map window, you can quickly turn layers on/off.
* Modeled objects and GIS layers are handled differently.

### Modeled Objects

To access the model objects layers,

1. open a network
2. right click in the map
3. click “Properties & Themes…”

Then you can turn each layer on/off, change the themes and labels.

You can also use the Key window to turn a layer on/off

### **GIS Layers**

GIS layers are managed through the “GIS Layer control…”

You can use the GIS layer control to add GIS layers and update the theme for the layer.

By default, you will use the MapXtreme support for GIS layers. If you do have a need to load map layers directly out of ArcMap, switch to using ArcGIS as the map control,

Refer to the help for more information.

### Other tips

#### Showing the Z values, 2D simulation results at the bottom of the window when you move your mouse around

Check the “Visual” tab in the “Properties and Themes” window.

#### Showing radar rainfall cell boundary

It is not that easy to see where the radar rainfall cells are when it is not raining.

Here is how to turn the cell boundary on.

#### Show details of 2D mesh

Sometimes you might be interested in a particular type of 2D elements. You can change the settings.
