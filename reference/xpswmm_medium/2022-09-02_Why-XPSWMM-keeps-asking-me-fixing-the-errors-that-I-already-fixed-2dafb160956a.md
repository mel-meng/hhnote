I have a few customers having this very frustrating problem. XPSWMM keeps asking him to fix problems he already fixed.

A closer look showed that the way the scenario manager works can be confusing sometimes.

As shown below, clearly the ground elevation is not 0, but XPSWMM keeps giving me this error, what went wrong?

The reason is when you run an XPSWMM model with scenarios, it only runs the one that is checked in the Scenario Manager, not the one being edited in the map window.
