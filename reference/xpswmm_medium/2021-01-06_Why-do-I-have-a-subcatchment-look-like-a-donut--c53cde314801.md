### Why do I have a subcatchment look like a donut?

Delineating subcatchment to most people is not a particularly interesting task. But from time to time, it can be fun. Yesterday I got a call from a customer asking how to import a subcatchment that looks like a donut into the model.

My first reaction was what on earth is this thing? Why does it have a hole?

Eventually I talked to the customer, the time she opened the model, I knew the answer.

It is a treatment plant! Now I remembered the storm water project I did a long time ago for the **same plant**. For the facilities that process sludge, it needs to have a buffer so that all the storm water from these buffer where sludge can spill drains to the sanitary sewer instead, and that’s why we need these holes in the subcatchments.

The benefits of working as a support engineer, got to see some of the unexpected fun things from time to time.
