### Culvert Performance Curve

When using swmm5/xpswmm/ICM models for drainage design, I often feel uneasy because I cannot calibrate the model. So how do I know my modeling approach and my selection of the parameters will give acceptable results. One of the techniques I often use is to setup models using simpler models which are purposely built for design purposes.

Again, I think python can be a great addition for situations like this. The method I’ll show here can be easily verified by a reviewer, a [killer feature](https://thenewstack.io/jupyter-notebooks-challenge-reproducibility/) of Jupyter Notebooks. And the ability to mix calculation and notes in one place just feel so natural.
