From time to time, the 2D results might not show up in XPSWMM. Most of the time you can get the results showing up with a few simple steps.

### Select scenario & global storm

Select the global storm or the scenario in the dropdown list will reload the results.

### Add 2D results

If you still don’t see the results, try load the XMDF result file directly. XMDF file stores the 2D results. You can find it in the results folder.

By default, it is in the 2D/Output/\*.xmdf subfolder where the \*.xp file is saved. And the xmdf file is named as scenario\_storm.xmdf.
