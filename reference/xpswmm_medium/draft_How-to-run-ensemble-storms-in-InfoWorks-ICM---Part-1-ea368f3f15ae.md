### How to run ensemble storms in InfoWorks ICM — Part 1

As it is getting more and more challenging to fully eliminate flooding issues in well developed urban areas due to cost and available land, the decision making process will look very similar to buying an insurance, I need to know how much risk reduction my money can buy, for more discussion refer to this [article](https://mel-meng-pe.medium.com/when-do-i-need-to-switch-from-a-single-design-storms-to-an-ensemble-of-storms-8d0118f0a93f).

ICM added support for [NOAA Atlas 14 ensemble rainfall generator](https://help2.innovyze.com/infoworksicm/Content/HTML/ICM_ILCM/NOAA_Storm_Generator.htm) in 2021.7, with only a few clicks you can get all the temporal distribution you need for your study area in minutes, a [manual process](https://mel-meng-pe.medium.com/how-to-run-an-atlas-14-ensemble-in-xpswmm-ea74dec92843) used to take at least 30 minutes.

With ensemble rainfall, instead of a single simulation, we’ll get a group of simulations representing an ensemble of rainfall temporal distributions.

We can use gas price as an analogy to explain how this works. Say if you are planning for a road trip for 3 days, however, you don’t have a big budget to work with, you need to know how much you’ll need to spend on gas to decide how much you can spend on hotel.

However, since you don’t have full control of your trip, so you don’t know exactly where you’ll need to stop and when exactly you’ll leave for the trip. So how are you going to estimate the cost?

Here is the simplest way of doing it. Based on our best knowledge, I’ll have plan one route, then I’ll check the gas price at the planned stops and calculate how much it will cost. The problem with this approach is that we know for sure, the actually number is almost certain to be different than this number, because we are not sure about the total mileage and the gas price.

What we really need is a range, most likely it will be between two numbers, and here are the numbers to back this up.
